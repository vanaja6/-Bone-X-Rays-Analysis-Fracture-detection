# Bone-X-Rays-Analysis-Fracture-detection

Collected, preprocessed, and labeled bone X-ray images to create a comprehensive dataset. Applied image processing techniques using OpenCV to enhance image quality and extract relevant features. Conducted rigorous testing and validation, achieving over 95% accuracy to ensure model reliability.

Implemented the trained model into a clinical setting to automate the diagnostic process. Ensured efficient deployment by integrating the model with existing clinical systems for seamless operation. Monitored model performance post-deployment, addressing issues to maintain accuracy and efficiency.
